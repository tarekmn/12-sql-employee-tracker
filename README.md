# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

A client has reached out to me about building an interface that allows anyone the ability to view and interact with the information stored in databases, also known as a CMS. This application will be built from scratch using a command-line that will prompt easy to read questions that will help manage the employee database.
